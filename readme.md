Project Documentation
Overview
This project is a web application built using FastAPI, designed to facilitate a social platform where users can create accounts, post content, like and comment on posts, follow other users, and manage business listings. The application utilizes a PostgreSQL database for data storage and SQLAlchemy for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
Tech Stack
Backend Framework: FastAPI
Database: PostgreSQL
ORM: SQLAlchemy
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication
Password Hashing: Passlib for secure password storage
Data Validation: Pydantic for data validation and serialization
Asynchronous Support: Uvicorn as the ASGI server
CORS Middleware: FastAPI's built-in CORS middleware for handling cross-origin requests
Environment Management: Python-dotenv for managing environment variables
Data Science Libraries: Pandas and Scikit-learn for data manipulation and machine learning tasks
Project Structure
api/index.py: The main application file containing the FastAPI app, routes, models, and database interactions.
api/_init_.py: An empty file that marks the directory as a Python package.
api/.env: Environment variables for database connection and secret keys.
api/alembic.ini: Configuration file for Alembic, a database migration tool for SQLAlchemy.
api/env.py: Script for managing database migrations using Alembic.
api/requirements.txt: A list of dependencies required to run the project.
Features
User Management: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
Business Listings: Users can create, update, and delete business listings.
Posts: Users can create posts, like/unlike them, and comment on them.
Follow System: Users can follow and unfollow each other.
Favorites: Users can mark posts as favorites.
Sharing: Users can share posts and business listings.
Health Check Endpoint: A simple endpoint to check if the API is running.
Usage
1. Setup Environment:
Clone the repository.
Create a virtual environment and activate it.
Install dependencies using:
Configure Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the api directory with the following content:
- Replace username, password, and db_name with your PostgreSQL credentials.
3. Run Database Migrations:
Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running.
Run the migrations using Alembic:
Start the Application:
Run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:
5. Access the API:
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/api/docs to access the interactive API documentation provided by FastAPI.
Adjustments
Adding New Features: To add new features, create new routes in api/index.py and define the corresponding models and schemas.
Database Changes: Modify the SQLAlchemy models in api/index.py and create new migrations using Alembic.
Environment Variables: Adjust the .env file to change database configurations or secret keys as needed.
Dependencies: Update the requirements.txt file to include any new libraries you may need.
Conclusion
This project serves as a robust foundation for building a social platform with user-generated content and business listings. With FastAPI's speed and ease of use, along with PostgreSQL's reliability, developers can extend and customize the application to meet their specific needs.

Detailed Explanation of index.py 📜
The index.py file is the main entry point for the FastAPI application. It contains the application setup, route definitions, database models, and various functionalities that power the API. Below is a detailed breakdown of its components:
1. Imports 📦
The file begins with a series of import statements that bring in necessary libraries and modules:
FastAPI: The main framework for building the API.
SQLAlchemy: Used for database interactions and ORM.
Pydantic: For data validation and serialization.
Uvicorn: The ASGI server to run the application.
Other Libraries: Various libraries for handling security, date/time, and data manipulation.
2. Configuration Constants 🔑
The file defines several constants for JWT authentication and database settings:
SECRET_KEY: Used for encoding and decoding JWT tokens.
ALGORITHM: The algorithm used for JWT encoding.
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES: Duration for which the access token is valid.
3. Settings Class 📜
A class to manage application settings using environment variables:
BaseSettings: A Pydantic class that loads environment variables from a .env file.
4. Database Setup 🗄️
The database connection and session management are established here:
create_engine: Connects to the PostgreSQL database.
SessionLocal: A session factory for database operations.
Base: The declarative base class for defining models.
5. Database Models 🏗️
The file defines several SQLAlchemy models representing the database tables:
User Model 👤
- Represents users in the system with fields like username, email, and relationships to other models.
Business Model 🏢
- Represents business listings with fields like title, description, and relationships to users.
Post Model 📝
- Represents posts created by users, including content and relationships to comments and likes.
Other Models
Comment, Follow, Like, Favorite, and Share models are defined similarly, representing their respective functionalities.
6. Dependency Injection 🔄
The get_db function provides a database session for route handlers:
This function ensures that a database session is created and closed properly for each request.
7. API Routes 🌐
The FastAPI application is defined, and routes are created for various functionalities:
Health Check Route: A simple endpoint to check if the API is running.
User Routes: Endpoints for user registration, login, and profile management.
Business Routes: Endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting business listings.
Post Routes: Endpoints for creating posts, liking/unliking, and commenting.
8. Middleware 🛡️
CORS middleware is added to handle cross-origin requests:
This allows the API to be accessed from different origins, which is essential for frontend applications.
9. Running the Application 🚀
Finally, the application is run using Uvicorn:
This block ensures that the application starts when the script is executed directly.
